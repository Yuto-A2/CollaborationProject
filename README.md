TeacherMealPlan, StudentMealPlan, Student. Teacher.
- Extra work...Can edit pictures in StudentMealPlan

- A self evaluation*60/100
  -  I finished "AddStudenttoMealPlan" and "AddTeachertoMealPlan", but I did not finish "RemoveStudentFromMealPlan" and "RemoveTeacherFromMealPlan"
  -  I added validation, picture editing, and JavaScript to ensure that the form cannot be submitted if it is empty.

A brief (1-2 paragraphs) reflection on this project.:

I did not make login function and editing picutres function last passion project. I tried to add them. It was hard to understand Cookie for login function (I do not still understand well), so I would like to keep learning about C# and .net. It was also hard to communicate with collaborators. I learned the importance of comments. This was a good opportunity to work as a team.

I have another chance

Noah - documentation, fixing some relationships in models, NutritionalNeeds model, workouts & exercises
looked into extra feature of calculating Activity level, nutritional needs and meal plan recommendation
plan: start with Count() method in the student/teacher api controller for activity level

Breno -

- Commented and implemented sections for recipe, recipeIngredient, RecipeTag, ReminderNotes
- Fixed partially the CRUD functionality, still working on it
- Fixed dbo.recipes
- Added QOL features and Basic Views (Design will be implemented later)
```
