- A self evaluation*60/100
  -  I finished "AddStudenttoMealPlan" and "AddTeachertoMealPlan", but I did not finish "RemoveStudentFromMealPlan" and "RemoveTeacherFromMealPlan"
  -  I added validation, picture editing, and JavaScript to ensure that the form cannot be submitted if it is empty.

- A brief reflection on this project.:

I did not make login function and editing picutres function last passion project. I tried to add them. It was hard to understand Cookie for login function (I do not still understand well), so I would like to keep learning about C# and .net. It was also hard to communicate with collaborators. I learned the importance of comments. This was a good opportunity to work as a team.

If I had another chance similiar this project, I would like to picture function. I only added it for editing function, so I would like to try to add in adding function.
